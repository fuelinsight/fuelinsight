- We are @fuelinsight - an energy analytics consultancy with a focus on the future of fuel ⛽ - from oil 🛢 to renewables 🍃.
- The energy transition will only work if the economics 💸 work and we are here to crunch the numbers so you don't have to!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on articles, analysis, or studies.
- 📫 Please reach out to us at blawrence@fuelinsight.com!
